# Age of GOLD

This is the backend of the Age of GOLD project. Here we will store the hexagonal map information.

## Run in dev

Some services need to be running and configured; you can start them with docker-compose.

Build the AoG image:

    docker build -t aog .

Run the image you just built:

    docker run -it aog
